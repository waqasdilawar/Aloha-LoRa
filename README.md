# LoRa
R Programming Script to simulate the ALOHA and Slotted ALOHA Medium Access Control Layer.

# Note
As I have very basic knowledge of ALOHA and Slotted ALOHA, so if anyone found any issue then let me know and I'll update the code accordingly.
Currently I'm working to generate plots as Maarten done in his simulation.
